# 🚗🔍 Vehicle Identification with Triplet Loss 🏎️

This repository focuses on a **deep learning approach for vehicle identification** using the concept of **triplet loss** to ensure robust feature embeddings for similarity-based tasks.

---

## 📂 Project Overview

- Developed a deep learning model for vehicle identification by learning meaningful embeddings.
- Utilized **triplet loss** to distinguish between vehicles based on their feature representations.
- Implemented end-to-end training with positive, negative, and anchor samples for optimal embedding space creation.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 **Triplet Loss Optimization**: Ensures the distance between embeddings of similar vehicles is minimized while increasing the distance for different vehicles.
- 🖼️ **Image Preprocessing**: Images normalized and augmented for training robustness.
- 🧠 **Deep Learning Architecture**:
  - Embedding generation network.
  - Fine-tuned hyperparameters for balanced loss minimization.
- 📊 **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy of embedding clustering.
  - Visualizations for embedding distributions.
